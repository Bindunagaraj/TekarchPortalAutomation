/*What is Tooltip?
A tooltip is a small text pop-up that users can view when they hover over a specific web element like button, image, link, etc.
 These small pop-ups provide short and precise contextual text that helps users understand what the web-element is all about.
----->In some cases the success messages like
successfully added , deleted and in some other case Tool-tip i.e some names on bar comes only we click and goes when we takesoff
InOrder to read and find the location of these things we need to go to source and pouse Debugger or
ctrl + \ = will help to pouse the page or press F8(this dint work for me)
To handle tool tip we use actions class and movedToElement().perform; method
